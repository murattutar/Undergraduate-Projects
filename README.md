Murat Tutar – Undergraduate Projects (Bogazici University, Industrial Engineering, Class of 2024)

**Background**

Murat Tutar completed his B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering at Bogazici University in Istanbul, graduating in 2024.  During his undergraduate studies he worked on a diverse set of projects and assignments spanning data mining, operations research, simulation and applied optimization.

**Projects**

1. **Classification of Emails Using R (IE425 Decision Trees & Random Forests):**  This assignment explored spam detection using decision trees and random forests.  The dataset contained 4 601 emails described by 57 attributes and no missing valuesraw.githubusercontent.com/murattutar/Undergraduate-Projects/main/Classification%20of%20Emails%20Using%20R.pdf#:~:text=%E2%97%8F%20%20The%20shape%20of,null%20value%20%E0%B6%88n%20the%20dataset.  The data were split 80/20 into training and test sets.  A large decision tree was grown and pruned to an optimal size of 64 leaves using cross‑validation.  The pruned tree achieved higher accuracy (≈0.92) and precision (≈0.93) than the largest treeraw.githubusercontent.com/murattutar/Undergraduate-Projects/main/Classification%20of%20Emails%20Using%20R.pdf#:~:text=error%20rate%2C%20false%20pos%E0%B6%88t%E0%B6%88ve%20rate%2C,0781759.  Metrics such as false‑positive and false‑negative rates were compared, illustrating how pruning improved generalization.

2. **Estimating AGV Requirements for a Manufacturing System (IE312 project):**  In this report the team assessed whether and how many automated guided vehicles (AGVs) should be deployed in a factory.  They surveyed advantages (e.g., labour cost savings and safety) and disadvantages (high capital cost, limited flexibility) of AGVsraw.githubusercontent.com/murattutar/Undergraduate-Projects/main/Estimating%20AGV%20Requirements%20for%20a%20Manufacturing%20System.pdf#:~:text=2.1%20,1.  Using methods from Egbelu’s article, they computed required AGV numbers under four analytical methods and compared resultsraw.githubusercontent.com/murattutar/Undergraduate-Projects/main/Estimating%20AGV%20Requirements%20for%20a%20Manufacturing%20System.pdf#:~:text=the%20benefits%20and%20disadvantages%20of,methods%20together%20with%20the%20benefits.  The study concluded that the third method provided the most comprehensive approach and recommended deploying five vehiclesraw.githubusercontent.com/murattutar/Undergraduate-Projects/main/Estimating%20AGV%20Requirements%20for%20a%20Manufacturing%20System.pdf#:~:text=that%20would%20be%20serving%20is,when%20compared%20to%20its%20peers.

3. **Forecasting Gasoline and Diesel Sales (IE360 project):**  This team project forecasted gasoline (UGS) and diesel (DGS) sales using both time‑series and regression models.  After plotting the data, they observed seasonality (peak sales in July, troughs in January) and a downward trend for gasoline while diesel sales increased over timeraw.githubusercontent.com/murattutar/Undergraduate-Projects/main/Forecasting%20Gasoline%20and%20Diesel%20Sales.pdf#:~:text=We%20visually%20examined%20the%20data%27s,do%20not%20look%20stationary%20because.  The dataset was tested for stationarity with Augmented Dickey–Fuller tests and differencing was applied to make the series stationaryraw.githubusercontent.com/murattutar/Undergraduate-Projects/main/Forecasting%20Gasoline%20and%20Diesel%20Sales.pdf#:~:text=2,Analysis.  Autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation analyses guided ARIMA model selectionraw.githubusercontent.com/murattutar/Undergraduate-Projects/main/Forecasting%20Gasoline%20and%20Diesel%20Sales.pdf#:~:text=When%20we%20analyze%20the%20autocorrelation,relation%20with%20the%20decreasing%20trend.  Regression models incorporated variables like fuel prices and components of Gross National Product, and the team compared model performance to select the best forecasting approach.

4. **Production Planning with Python PuLP (IE313 assignment):**  Murat formulated an aggregate production planning model for basic and pro caravans.  The decision variables included monthly production levels, inventories, workforce size, overtime, hiring and firing.  Using Python’s PuLP library he minimized total cost while meeting monthly demand.  The base model achieved an optimal total cost of $3.506 millionraw.githubusercontent.com/murattutar/Undergraduate-Projects/main/Python%20PuLP%20-%20Production%20Planning.pdf#:~:text=The%20optimum%20total%20cost%20is,production%20and%20inventory%20is%20below.  Alternative scenarios allowed extra workforce in certain months, reducing cost slightly to $3.505 millionraw.githubusercontent.com/murattutar/Undergraduate-Projects/main/Python%20PuLP%20-%20Production%20Planning.pdf#:~:text=with%2060%20hours%20and%202160,total%20cost%20decreased%20to%20%243%2C505%2C712.  The analysis showed that inventory holding costs were preferable to workforce hiring costs; thus production was smoothed and overtime was used before high‑demand monthsraw.githubusercontent.com/murattutar/Undergraduate-Projects/main/Python%20PuLP%20-%20Production%20Planning.pdf#:~:text=Overall%2C%20in%20every%20three%20model%3B,workers%20and%20keeping%20low%20inventory.

5. **Queue Simulation – Discrete Event Scheduling (IE306 homework):**  Murat simulated a two‑server queueing system using random number streams.  Interarrival times were uniformly distributed between 5 and 17 minutes and service times had separate distributions for each serverraw.githubusercontent.com/murattutar/Undergraduate-Projects/main/Queue%20Simulation%20-%20Discrete%20Event%20Scheduling.pdf#:~:text=IE%20306%20Homework%202%20%E2%80%93,12%201.  Calculations were performed in R and a C++ implementation reproduced the event‑driven simulationraw.githubusercontent.com/murattutar/Undergraduate-Projects/main/Queue%20Simulation%20-%20Discrete%20Event%20Scheduling.pdf#:~:text=a,include%20%3Calgorithm.  The simulation generated arrival and departure events, tracked queue length and server status, and computed performance measures such as waiting times and system utilization.

6. **Queue Simulation with ARENA (IE306 homework 6):**  This assignment used Rockwell Arena to model a food service system.  The simulation generated multiple replications and reported statistics such as time spent in the service queue, average queue lengths and server utilizationraw.githubusercontent.com/murattutar/Undergraduate-Projects/main/Queue%20Simulation%20with%20ARENA.pdf#:~:text=TALLY%20VARIABLES.  Results across four replications highlighted how average utilization of food servers approached 0.75–0.90 and the cashier around 0.75raw.githubusercontent.com/murattutar/Undergraduate-Projects/main/Queue%20Simulation%20with%20ARENA.pdf#:~:text=Identifier%20%20%20%20,Observations%20____________________________________________________________________________.

7. **Object‑Oriented Game Design and Implementation:**  In a software engineering course Murat collaborated on designing and implementing a game using object‑oriented principles.  The project involved defining classes for players, enemies and game mechanics, applying inheritance and polymorphism, and developing a user interface.  (Artifacts in the repository include a ZIP archive with source code and executable.)

8. **Unconstrained Mathematical Optimisation – Gradient Descent:**  This project focused on implementing gradient descent algorithms for solving unconstrained optimization problems.  The team developed code to compute gradients, apply step‑size rules, and visualise convergence on test functions.  The ZIP archive contains code and documentation.

9. **Conversational Schedule Explainer with ChatGPT – Graduation Thesis (IE492):**  Murat’s capstone project addressed the lack of transparency in employee scheduling.  The system integrates a Gurobi optimization model with the ChatGPT API to provide natural‑language explanations of scheduling decisionsraw.githubusercontent.com/murattutar/Undergraduate-Projects/main/XAI%20for%20Transparency%20-%20GenAI%20in%20Explaining%20a%20Gurobi-based%20optimization%20model.pdf#:~:text=Abstract.  The report discusses problem definition, requirements, literature review and design methodology, and describes how the interface answers query, request and reasoning questions.  By enabling employees to ask why they received certain shifts and by explaining optimization constraints, the tool aims to enhance employee engagement and operational efficiency.
